"""Rectangle module.

This module defines a Rectangle class that represents a geometric rectangle.
The class follows PEP 8 style guidelines and provides a foundation for
rectangle-related operations.

Example:
    Basic usage of the Rectangle class:

    >>> rect = Rectangle()
    >>> isinstance(rect, Rectangle)
    True

Attributes:
    None currently defined.

Todo:
    * Add width and height attributes
    * Implement area and perimeter calculations
    * Add validation for dimensions

class Rectangle:
    """A class to represent a rectangle.

    This class provides a basic structure for creating rectangle objects.
    Currently serves as a placeholder for future rectangle functionality.

    Attributes:
        None currently defined.

    Methods:
        None currently defined.

    Example:
        Creating a basic rectangle instance:

        >>> rectangle = Rectangle()
        >>> type(rectangle).__name__
        'Rectangle'

    Note:
        This is a minimal implementation. Future versions will include
        attributes like width, height, and methods for calculations.
